Kind of heavy for watching on in-flight entertainment though, so I watched less serious films on planes in the future."

To quote a Rotten Tomatoes review, \"a very long ASMR video.\" The slow pace is fine, but it also felt like not much really happened, and I wasn't able to get into it nearly as much as others such as Drive My Car. The scenes in the vehicle also felt very repetitive."

This movie also has special personal significance because the characters were the same graduating year as me."
